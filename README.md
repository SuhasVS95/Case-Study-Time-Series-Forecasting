# Case-Study-Time-Series-Forecasting

A detailed case study on the time series forecasting of the sales with various forecasting approaches.

# Problem Statement

Since this case study only about the "Univariate Time Series Forecasting",we will be considering the variable "Number of Tractor Sold" for the forecasting purspose over the given period of time to forecast for 1 more year in the future.

# About the Dataset:

We have used a dataset which has the sales details on the tractor over 10 years of time.

# Work Flow

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Applying different modelling techniques(Exponential Smoothing, ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA)
3. Identifying the appropriate model wrt RMSE and MAPE
4. Fitting the entire dataset for the best model to forecast data for 1 year in the future.
